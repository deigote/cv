\section{About me}

I am a \textbf{software engineer} interested in distributed systems and web technologies (specially backend, but also
frontend). I am highly experienced in \textbf{web services} and \textbf{microservices} development, particularly with
\textbf{Scala}, \textbf{Groovy} and \textbf{J2EE} in general.

\vspace{2mm}

I have also been the \textbf{lead engineer} in several projects, working in an \textbf{agile} environment and focusing
on the analysis, design and development, as well as in sharing knowledge, fostering decission making and training
colleagues. I love \textbf{programming}, \textbf{architecture designing} and \textbf{training} others hands-on.

\vspace{2mm}

I also enjoy \textbf{cloud based architectures} and have some experience with \textbf{devops} techniques. In that area
I have extensively used \textbf{Amazon AWS} (Cloudformation, Lambda, API Gateway, and others), \textbf{Docker} and
\textbf{Puppet}.

\cvlistitem{I joined the company as a senior software engineer to be part of the migration of their IT setup to the
cloud. We are building a \textbf{microservices} architecture based on \textbf{AWS} solutions, with a focus on
\textbf{automation} and \textbf{architecture as code}. Most of our services are written in \textbf{Scala} and use the
\textbf{Play} framework, while our main data backbone is supported by \textbf{Kafka}. On top of that, I particularly
have had the opportunity of working with AWS \textbf{Lambda}, DynamoDB and Kinesis, as well as Apache Avro, Open API or
Akka Streams.}
\cvlistitem{After a succesful first year being part of the team that was in charge of releasing the new homepage to the
19 countries the company is present in, I was promoted to \textbf{Lead software engineer}, a position which further
encourages my abilities to share knowledge, foster decission making, train colleagues and lead technical and
 architectural changes.}

agents and providing a scalable, \textbf{cloud-based architecture} for hosting our different
services in \textbf{AWS using docker}.}
